This is a list of IDs and their corresponding German nouns.
For each noun, provide the ID and the corresponding English word using the following format:
"""
ID,English word
"""
Since each German word has a definite article, also provide 'the' with each English word.
If the English word corresponds to multiple German words, include a concise explanation to differentiate them.
However, make sure that the English word itself is limited to less than 30 characters.
Your response should include only the list.
